if I'm going to give any conclusion, I'd say if you want any more sophisticated me method than star, hme is the choice. (the "me=star" in hme one is just a placeholder, hme will replace "traditional" me methods.)  
more detailed hme settings test coming.  
others are close, that's why my tune f reduces me settings first, a good trade off.
