two "traditional" star search results included as baseline.  
star in L1 makes the speed drop vastly for some mysterious reason, sea doesn't like to be put in anywhere but L2 (crashes x265). hmm, weird.  
it seems like the star,umh,star combination will be my winner here. but even 3-step hex search can match what preset placebo use with much faster speed.
I'll test 3-step full search out of insanity, it'll be a separate report.  
and sorry for the mess in the legends area, this happens when too many data groups are present, I don't know how to fix it (yet?). but you can use html report it's semi-interactive although I have no idea why they are so huge neither.
