using my [x265-Yuuki-3.5+2-pgo-2](https://github.com/Mr-Z-2697/x265-Yuuki-Asuna/releases/download/3.5/x265-Yuuki-3.5+2-pgo-2.7z) build.  
I have done this, of course, many times, several years ago, and from time to time. but those were on different cpus, with different x265 versions, or not using this tool, so I kinda want to do it again with more normalized conditions.
